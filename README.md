**Lab – Build a Sample Web App in a Docker Container**

In this lab, you will review basic bash scripting techniques because bash scripting is a prerequisite for the rest of the lab. You will then build and modify a Python script for a simple web application. Next, you will create a bash script to automate the process for creating a Dockerfile, building the Docker container, and running the Docker container. Finally, you will use docker commands to investigate the intricacies of the Docker container instance.
You will complete the following objectives:

•	Part 1: Launch the DEVASC VM

•	Part 2: Create a Simple Bash Script

•	Part 3: Create a Sample Web App

•	Part 4: Configure the Web App to Use Website Files

•	Part 5: Create a Bash Script to Build and Run a Docker Container

•	Part 6: Build, Run, and Verify the Docker Container
